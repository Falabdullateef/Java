# Brute Force Solutions for Kangaroo Math Competition

This repository serves as a playground for devising and testing brute force solutions to problems posed in the Kangaroo Math Competition using Java. The Kangaroo competition is an esteemed international mathematical contest that captivates students with a spectrum of intriguing problems. While the brute force approach showcased here may not represent the most efficient or elegant solutions, it offers a definitive path to finding solutions, albeit at the cost of higher computational time. This exercise is not only a quest for answers but a venture into comprehending the essence and structure of the problems encountered in this competition.

## Getting Started

Begin by cloning this repository and navigating to the `Kangaroo` directory, which houses the Java files containing the brute force solutions.

## Dependencies

- Java JDK 11 or later

## How to Run

1. Ensure that Java JDK is installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the `Kangaroo` directory.
3. Compile the Java file for the problem you wish to solve, for instance:
    ```bash
