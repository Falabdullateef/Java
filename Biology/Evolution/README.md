# UPGMA Algorithm Implementation in Java

## Description
The UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) algorithm is a distance-based method used for constructing phylogenetic trees. Given a set of species and a distance matrix, the algorithm helps in deducing the hierarchical clustering that showcases evolutionary relationships.

This repository contains a Java-based implementation of the UPGMA algorithm, where users can input DNA sequences, and the code outputs the corresponding tree structure.

## Features
- DNA sequence input for multiple species.
- Constructs a phylogenetic tree based on sequence similarity.
- Console-based UI for easy interaction and visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Running the Program
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the `UPGMA.java` file:

## Usage
1. Provide the number of species you want to compare.
2. Enter the DNA sequences for each species.
3. The program will display the phylogenetic tree structure based on the input sequences.
